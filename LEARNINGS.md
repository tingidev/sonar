Technical explanations of what we're building and why, written as we go. Each section maps to a milestone or decision point.

## Project Setup

### Why Poetry + src layout?

Poetry manages Python dependencies and packaging. The `src/` layout (as opposed to putting `sonar/` at the root) prevents a common bug: without `src/`, Python can accidentally import from your local source directory instead of the installed package. With `src/`, you must install the package (`poetry install`) before imports work — this guarantees your tests run against the same code a user would install.

### Why async throughout?

Sonar's operations involve I/O-heavy work: database queries, LLM API calls, MCP message handling. Async (`async`/`await`) lets Python handle multiple I/O operations without blocking. When you `await` a database query, Python can start an LLM call in parallel instead of waiting idle. This matters when scanning 50 tables — you could describe multiple tables concurrently rather than sequentially.

We use `psycopg` 3 (not `psycopg2`) specifically because it has native async support.

### Why frozen dataclasses?

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Column:
    name: str
    data_type: str
```

`frozen=True` means instances can't be modified after creation. If you want a different value, you create a new object. This eliminates an entire class of bugs where something accidentally modifies shared state. It also makes objects hashable (usable as dict keys or in sets) for free.

The tradeoff: slightly more memory (new objects instead of modifying in place). Irrelevant at our scale.
